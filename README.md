RogueRPG



Text based RPG Game, developed by gatefulDeadty


The redevelopment of my old text based rpg game I originally started in 2006. 
It was released orginally in 08, then 2010, and once again in 2012.

This will be an open source project, for anyone who want's to try out a pretty neat game.
